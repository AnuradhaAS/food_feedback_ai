## 📖 Project Overview

Food Feedback AI is an AI/ML-based sentiment analysis project that analyzes large-scale customer food reviews to understand customer opinions and automatically generate actionable business insights.

The project combines:
- Traditional Machine Learning (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)
- Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) for deep language understanding

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Amazon Fine Food Reviews Dataset (Kaggle)**
- Contains **500,000+ customer food reviews**
- Text data used for sentiment analysis and insight generation

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK  
- TF-IDF Vectorizer  
- Transformers (DistilBERT LLM)  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🧠 Project Workflow

1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Text cleaning and tokenization  
3. Feature extraction using TF-IDF  
4. Sentiment classification using Logistic Regression (ML)  
5. LLM-based sentiment analysis using DistilBERT  
6. Automatic business insight generation  
7. Visualization of sentiment distribution  

---

## 🤖 AI & LLM Features

- Uses **DistilBERT (Transformer-based LLM)** for sentiment understanding
- Handles long reviews using truncation
- Generates business-level insights automatically from customer feedback

---

## 📈 Key Results

- Majority of customer reviews are **positive**
- Negative reviews highlight issues related to:
  - Delivery delays
  - Service experience
- Business recommendations are generated automatically using AI

---

## 📌 Final Business Insight

> Customer sentiment is overall **positive**, indicating strong food quality and satisfaction.  
> However, recurring negative feedback suggests the need to improve delivery speed and customer service for better user experience.
