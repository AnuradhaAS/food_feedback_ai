# Food Feedback AI
AI-based sentiment analysis and insight generation from food reviews

## Project Overview
Food Feedback AI is an AI/ML-based project that analyzes large-scale customer food reviews to understand customer sentiment and automatically generate business insights.

The project combines traditional machine learning techniques with transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) for deeper language understanding.
